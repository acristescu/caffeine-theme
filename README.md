These are my own modifications of the excellent Caffeine Theme for Ghost by Kelyvin. I use it for my Android programming [blog](http://zenandroid.io). Please visit the original [repo](https://github.com/kelyvin/caffeine-theme) for instructions on how to use it.

I mainly removed most of the effects and went for a more spartan look than the original as befits the title of the blog. I also added a feature to auto-generate the Table Of Contents, but not much else.
